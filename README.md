# VISUAL TREE ASSESSMENT

The VTA method is an internationally spread and acknowledgment method for tree inspection, hazard symptoms are construed, defects are confirmed and measured and criteria of failure are assessed. VTA helps to distinguish apparent hazardous trees from those that are really hazardous. This way safe trees are protected.

VTA gives information about the body language and the mechanics of trees and instructs you in the correct use of our test and measuring instruments.

## The web application

This application allows the compilation of VTA sheet via mobile devices, like tablets and smartphones.
I developed it following the Responsive Web Design (RWD) to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience ( easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling ) across a wide range of devices (from desktop computer monitors to mobile phones).
I used Bootstrap as front-end framework to achieve this goal.
This application is designed to be usable even in offline mode, using LocalStorage to store data locally, then push them to the server once back online.
